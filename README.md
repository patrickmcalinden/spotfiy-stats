<h1>Spotify Stats<h1>
<h3>Project Roots</h3>
I always liked Spotify's "End of Year Recap", so I decided to work with Spotify's API to make my own. I thought it was a bummer that Spotify never did a more frequent recap (spoiler alert...they actually do on the desktop app), so I decided that this would be a good/quick project to tackle while i'm brushing up on my JavaScript. 

<h3>Setup</h3>
For this project, I wanted to focus on the basics of JavaScript (preparing to learn React). After looking into some resources, I decided to use Bootstrap for the "design" so I can get the site up and running as quick as possible.

Before any coding took place, I looked at Spotify's API docs to make sure I would be able to get the info I was looking for. Spotify's docs are pretty clear (aside from user authentications) so I didn't spend to long on this.

<h3>Building</h3>
Overall, building this website was quick. The focus was using JavaScript and not too much onthe design. Overal, a positive experience  

<h3>Take away</h3>
This project has allowed me to brush up on my JavaScript skills before expanding my knowledge.
